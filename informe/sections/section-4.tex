\textbf{Describe the analysis of the environment (PEST). Explain all different items}\\

A PEST analysis examines the external factors that may impact a business or industry.
It stands for Political, Economic, Social, and Technological factors.

By considering these PEST factors, RefuApp can better understand the external environment in which it operates, anticipate potential opportunities and threats, and adapt its strategies accordingly to maximize success and sustainability.
